# Anomaly-Detection-CCTV


Anomaly Detection in CCTV Footage using Deep Learning
This project presents a deep learning-based system for detecting anomalous activities in CCTV footage. Inspired by the Smart India Hackathon challenge, it leverages MediaPipe for efficient pose estimation and an LSTM network for anomaly recognition.

Key Features:

Real-time anomaly detection: Analyzes video streams in real-time to identify unusual behaviors like crawling, running, punching, etc.
MediaPipe integration: Utilizes MediaPipe's lightweight and accurate pose estimation models for extracting skeletal data from video frames.
LSTM-based anomaly recognition: Trains an LSTM network on labeled activity data to differentiate between normal and anomalous actions.
Scalable and adaptable: Designed for easy deployment on CCTV systems and adaptable to various anomaly detection scenarios.
Potential Applications:

Enhanced security and surveillance: Identifying suspicious activities in public spaces, critical infrastructure, and sensitive areas.
Elderly care and fall detection: Monitoring elderly individuals for abnormal movements and potential falls.
Workplace safety and hazard detection: Recognizing unsafe behaviors in industrial settings and preventing accidents.
Project Status:

This project is currently under development, with an initial prototype demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. Further research and refinement are ongoing to improve accuracy, robustness, and real-world applicability.

Next Steps:

Expand the training dataset with diverse anomaly scenarios.
Explore and compare different deep learning architectures for improved performance.
Implement real-time anomaly alerts and notification systems.
Conduct field tests and evaluations in relevant application settings.
Contributions:

We welcome contributions from the community in the form of code improvements, suggestions for data acquisition and labeling, and ideas for extending the project's capabilities.
